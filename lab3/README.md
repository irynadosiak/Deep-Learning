# Homework #3 - Tabular Data

**Generate a large tabular dataset with 10 features, 1 regression target, 150 000 rows** 

 - I generated data similar to a real diabetes dataset. Dataset contains 10 features - symptoms and 1 target - the presence or absence of the disease. For this I used NumPy.
 - After that, I tried to build a relationship between the target and the features.
 - I also normalized the data by MinMax.
