# Homework #5 - Computer Vision

Attach binaries including the following three trained models:
- Plain 3-layer CNN 
- Frozen pre-trained ResNet as feature extractor 
- Fine-tuned pre-trained ResNet

Attach train/validation results reported in the following form:
- sklearn.metrics.classification_report
- 101x101 confusion matrices
- Learning curves or TensorBoards 
- ROC Curve plot
- AUC-PRC plot
- The top-1 error rate in %

Visualize filters aligned with corresponding activation maps

**Results**

### 3-layer CNN - 9.3% 
### Frozen pre-trained ResNet as feature extractor - 2.9%
### Fine-tuned pre-trained ResNet - 4.6%
